# SNEngine Code Editor

The SNEngine Code Editor (SNIL Editor) is a specialized text editor for working with SNIL (SNEngine Intermediate Language) files in SNEngine visual novel projects. It provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and other features tailored for the SNIL scripting language used in SNEngine visual novel development.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for SNIL files with support for directives, dialogue, comments, and keywords
- File management for SNEngine projects with tree view navigation
- Dialogue visualization and map panel to view conversation flow
- Script graph visualization to understand the structure of your visual novel
- Integration with SNEngine project structure
- Real-time error checking and validation
- Customizable themes and settings
- Auto-save functionality
- Session management to restore open tabs
- File splitting capabilities for large dialogue files

## Purpose

The SNEngine Code Editor simplifies the process of creating and editing SNIL scripts for visual novels built with the SNEngine framework. SNIL appears to be a domain-specific language for creating visual novel content with commands for dialogue, character management, background changes, conditional logic, and more. The editor provides developers with a dedicated environment that understands the SNIL syntax and provides helpful tools for faster and more efficient development.

## File Types Supported

- `.snil` files - SNIL script files containing visual novel dialogue and logic
- Project folders containing multiple SNIL files organized in a structured format

## Installation

To install and use the SNEngine Code Editor:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system
2. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application with: `python src/main.py`

## Usage

The editor can be used to create and edit SNIL script files used in SNEngine projects, including:
- Character dialogue and interactions
- Background and character management
- Conditional logic and branching storylines
- Function definitions and calls
- Variable assignments and comparisons
